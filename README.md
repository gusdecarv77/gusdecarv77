# 👋 Hi, I'm [Your Name]

### Germanist & Translator | AI Engineering Student | NLP Specialist

I am bridging the gap between deep human linguistic analysis and technical AI implementation. With a decade of experience living across Germany and a **Master’s Degree from the University of Jena**, my transition into technology is driven by linguistic precision and the philosophy of media.

### 📚 Beyond the Code

When I'm not training models or writing Python, I focus on:
* Literary translation (specifically the works of Franz Kafka and Walter Benjamin).
* Calligraphy (German Fraktur Calligraphy).
* Researching the philosophy of technology, posthumanism & transhumanism.
